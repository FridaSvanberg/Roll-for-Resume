# Frida Svanberg – Front-End Developer (Level 7)

Welcome! This is my Dungeons & Dragons–inspired portfolio CV — built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and hosted via **GitHub Pages** at [rollforresume.xyz](https://rollforresume.xyz). It’s a creative, accessible, and responsive personal site that shares a little more personality than your average resume scroll — with a little Web3 magic on the side.
